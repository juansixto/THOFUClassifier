{"User":"peacarwales","text":"I'm currently staying in the Eden Plaza Hotel in Kensington, though thankfully for only one night. The fact I'm writing this review does imply one thing - that their wifi is pretty good, even if you're on the fourth floor like I am. However unfortunately this is pretty much where the positives end. While all rooms are en suite, it really is quite something when you see that the bathrooms are typically bigger than the bedrooms. The bedrooms are absolutely minuscule! Despite booking - what is meant to be - a double room, the bed is honestly little bigger than a single, and while this may not bother you too much if you're traveling alone, it really is so cramped that you can pretty much lay in bed and reach both walls with your arms outstretched. Despite only being 5\"6, the room is incredibly claustrophobic - made moreso by the desk and wardrobe adjacent to the bed. The staff, to be fair, were very pleasant upon check in, however the whole hotel lacks character and seems very bland and sterile. The downstairs bar was not appealing in the slightest, hence I chose to go to Waitrose and buy a bottle for the room instead to try to drown out my sorrows. Overall, this is fine for a one night trip, but I cannot emphasise enough how small these rooms are. I had come with the intention of doing some PhD work in the evening however there is no discernible 'desk' as such so it's pretty difficult to get on with anything and I do wish that I had opted to stay at a local Premier Inn, which was £10 less with a room that would've been about five times as big. Judging by other reviews, I think there are far better hotels in the local area which - while maybe a little more expensive - do provide a better overall quality of accommodation. Unfortunately the hotel's website seems to portray far bigger rooms than those that are available.","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Wales","Helpful":0,"date":"24 June 2013","sleepQ":0,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cFine for one night... if you're tiny!\u201d","Reviews":1,"value":2,"service":1,"cleanliness":5,"rating":3,"rooms":3}

The concert was on Monday night & we were heading home teatime the following day, so wanted to be near to other places we could see without having to travel out too far. This hotel is basic and the rooms very compact but excellent for a short stay (lets face it if you want to enjoy London you are not going to spend much time in your room). Found beds very comfortable and had good nights sleep. Excellent shower. I would definately stay here again. Everything was very clean and in good order. As they only did continental breakfast we decided to eat out as there are lots of places nearby where you can eat.The location was superb and very easy to find, in a prominant position. A very leisurely 15 mins stroll in a good area to the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park. There is a choice of Museums just across the road from the hotel on Cromwell Road - Natural History & Victoria and Albert Museums and round the corner from these is the Science Museum. We met up at Euston Station and took the tube to Charing Cross so that we could go and have a coffee and food in the Crypt at St Martin in the Fields. Suitably refreshed and enjoying the buzz of many others doing the same, we crossed the road and spent the afternoon in the National Portrait Gallery before heading to our hotel. The following day we went to the Victoria & Albert and enjoyed looking around together. You can't see everything in one go as there is so much to see. I've been several times over the years. The tearooms here are fantastic and stunning - the beauty is still in my mind. The food (there was plenty offered for lunch - not cheap but we think well worth for a wonderful treat - or quick snacks) was such as a top eatery. Absolutely splendid in all senses. We are definately heading here again when next in London. After here we carried on a short walk down the road to Harrods which we love, and enjoyed the Dior Exhibition which was on at the time.

The room was very clean and the staff were really helpful and polite. The bed was positioned up against one of the walls which restricted the movement somewhat.There was no actual wardrobe just an alcove to hang our clothes. It was very handy for the tube and for shopping in Kensington and beyond. I would recommend it as a base for short sightseeing breaks but it may be too cramped for longer stays","hotelReviews":0,"location":3,"Location":"Stoke on Trent","Helpful":0,"date":"3 March 2013","sleepQ":1,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cCompact and bijou but very clean\u201d","Reviews":1,"value":1,"service":3,"cleanliness":4,"rating":4,"rooms":1}
{"User":"ToninNL","text":"On the positive side, staff were polite, room was clean (both minimum expectations) and hotel is in central location On negative side, hotel has on 2 sides large roads with heavy traffic day and night with the noise clearly audible and distracting throughout the hotel. I paid £60 per night for a single room (no breakfast) and got a cupboard in the duncheon (=the cellar) which they for convenience call floor1. Room size was less than 2m by 4m, with en-suite bathroom no bigger than a large toilet with a shower cramped in. Under the shower (with luke-warm water at best) it was difficult to wash my hair, because my elbows didn't have sufficient space to reach up. Wash basin was the smallest I have ever seen: my clenched fist fitted in there, but my spread-out hand did not (and I am not that well endowed). Finally, at around 7am the cleaning ladies start, making so much noise that the loud traffic noise during the night felt like a bliss. If you understand eastern European languages, it might be interesting to listen to small talk between cleaning ladies while working in different rooms, but if you have been awake all night because of the traffic roar outside, you are hardly in the mood for more unnecessary noise. In otherwords: don't even think about going here","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Helpful":0,"date":"28 February 2013","sleepQ":4,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cclean but cramped and noisy\u201d","Reviews":1,"value":4,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":2,"rooms":3}

{"User":"elninio7","text":"Hello all, I'll try to write a clear review for the hotel in order to help you decide if you want to go or not. I went to Eden Plaza at 9th of January 2013 and stayed there until the 14th. Booked the hotel early on September and got a very good price. So... Let's Start... Location: PERFECT Just 10mins walking to Glouchester Underground Station or South Kensington something that is really good. It is oposite the National History Museum which gives you a nice view to watch from window, and a small walk to go and visit it (Which is free to enter of course). ----------------------------------- Service: As good as it gets! People are very helpful although from first sight you cannot recognize it. Their answers are straight and not with a smiley face. But if you understand people's culture around the world you might feel better. The first day they explained everything to us, and informed us about some discounts on several sightseeings around london. (20% off in most of them). Wanted to book some luggage from easyjet at last night and although it was overtime (1 at night) and would open again the next day at 6.00, the guy in the reception let us do our job and did not charge us. (2 Pounds / 15 minutes is the charge). He also gave us the solution of changing our room when asked the first day (you will understand why change room later on..). Generally friendly and kind, but not much talking. (Which many times is better). ------------------------------------------- Room: New but Small (I mean REALLY small). We had read some reviews about menitoning that the room are small but could not imagine how small they would be. Entering the room it was a four-step hallway fitting one person (two people meeting there need traffic-lights and backward walking). On the left when entering there was the door for the bathroom and next a tiny kind-of closet (no doors no drawers) just to put 4 jackets (don't take so many) and two pair of shoes. (Clothes stay in luggage). Adding that on this tiny thing they have stuck their safe. At the second step you make you enter the main part of the room (a tiny main part). At the left is the bed (Double was booked), which fit 2 people if they are sleeping hugging each other or staying still while sleeping (forget personal space). At the end of bed (1,80m) and right there is a small mirror desk with 3 drawers (one has the hair dryer, the second has the water boiler and two cups with coffee,sugar,tea and the third is for you to put just something in height of two wallets. At the left there is a small space that fits one big luggage (Second is a problem). At the end there is a small window which has a cover and behind it the old wooden window that opens upwards. (If you stay next to it for long time you can freeze in winter). The good part of the room is the bathroom, which of course is tiny too, but is new, clean, and has hot water all the time. Small cabin for shower (i'm happy i'm not tall or overweighted). Clean towels daily offered. ----------------------------------- Cleanliness: Clean and Tidy, but not for clean freaks. Everything in the room at first sight look really clean and tidy. (They were even tide our clothes every day while being out.) At a closer look you could see some little stains at the pillow cases and sheets (not every day, as i said they were changing everything every day). Bathroom which is mainly important was perfectly clean. ------------------------------------- Sound: The old lady from the left might need to see a doctor and i hope the french couple at the right finally solved their argument. As you can understand the walls are paper-thin and you could hear everything. From a person changing bed side, to a couple arguing for personal matters. (Lovers should take it under serious consideration if they respect others). Not much traffic noise but police siren can easily wake you up even if you are on the 6th floor. --------------------------------------- WiFi: Still Trying to reach one bar of signal strength. In services it is mentioned that there is a WiFi (Free) service in the hotel but where we stayed the signal strength was absent. ----------------------------------------------- Breakfast: 7 Pounds per day for Coffee - Toast - Tea - Juice (Continental Breakfast) / Did not try it. There are many places near where you can have your coffee and your muffin or your full english breakfast much cheaper than this. --------------------------------------------- Conclusion: less luggage , less expectations and you're fine. Hotels in centre of London are all kind of the same in this price ranges. So if you want a central hotel very close to the underground and in a quiet and safe area without spending a fortune then this kind of hotels are what you get and what you can expect. Although my review is kind of hard, i would go and visit again this hotel without a question. It is that this time i would know what i could expect. I'm really sad i did not take photos to make it more clear about what i mention above but the morning i left had not time at all to do it. I hope i helped.

The room was very small, but adequate for our needs. The bathroom had a power shower and was spotlessly clean as was the room. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. There was a kettle, tea, coffee and milk all complimentary. The hotel is between two tube stations, I do think Gloucester Road has the edge and is just a little nearer. It is handy and convenient and most central. We did not have the breakfast as it was continental and my grandson and I wanted a cooked breakfast, so I cannot comment on breakfasts.

{"User":"cristina t","text":"Eden Plaza Hotel is a two star hotel with plenty of facilities considering the price paid (do not forget that you can find excellent accommodation at around £ 1,000 / night). It is recently renovated, is including free WiFi, hairdryer and kettle. Towels and sheets I thought were clean. In fact you can look on the hotel website, just do not mind at all. Including pictures are real, can only give an impression of more space. Indeed, there was little place, but enough to move two people in the room decently. Although not quite in the center, but about 15 minutes of this, I only went down to visit the British Museum, Buckingham Palace, etc etc. Across the street from the hotel is the Natural History Museum and Imperial College, so it's ideal for those going to the interview at Imperial (as we're about to do so many :)) I want to draw your attention on one thing though: outlets. I even got spikes with that single socket compatible with my phone charger was that the bathroom from the razor :)) and ironically, the bathroom had sensors, lights, and so and plug, if you do not Move about 10 minutes through it. It would be ideal to take with you an adapter, but be careful though that you use the adapter with a plate might appear to your hair loss that is too hot (something experienced by an acquaintance). You can take a morning breakfast (continental) the hotel is £ 7.50. However, to me it seems a bit much, considering that food that you find in the supermarket and at a price more affordable. Generally food is just like us that price or a bit more expensive (you're in Kensington) at the supermarket, but the restaurant is very expensive.","hotelReviews":34,"location":5,"Location":"London, United Kingdom","Helpful":66,"date":"14 November 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":55,"title":"\u201cnice hotel\u201d","Reviews":144,"value":5,"service":4,"cleanliness":5,"rating":4,"rooms":3}

Choose this hotel because of the location, which is fine for the museums and getting in to central London on the tube. There are two tube stations very close to this hotel. Hotel was refitted in 2010 so it was very clean and had good décor. The reception men were friendly when we arrived and went out each day. The rooms are small but if you are spending little time in them this isn\u2019t a problem. The bathroom (The room I had only had a shower) is compacted but again clean with good hot water and a strong shower. Unfortunately the hotel is on a corner of a main road with traffic lights and although there is secondary glazing this doesn\u2019t stop the noise from the traffic. I found that I couldn\u2019t get to sleep until about 0300 in the morning, which is very unfortunate. There is no lounge area as such (only a couple of corner sofas in the reception area) so there isn\u2019t any where to relax on a night, and the breakfast area was a bit plain I would have given this hotel 4 stars but the noise situation made it 3.

{"User":"Angela M","text":"Stayed here for 3 nights in October 2012 as was in London for business. I chose the hotel mainly for it's location, but also got a good deal on their own website. Considering the prices of hotels in London, I found this hotel really good value - felt very safe, comfortable, super clean, fairly modern. I wasn't looking for luxury, but it had everything I needed for all the time I actually spent there! I found the staff quite friendly enough and they were very helpful if I needed anything or had any questions. Lots of people comment on the room size - I had a single room which was quite compact but I didn't think it was that bad, especially as I was only sleeping there. However, I'm only 5'3\" so it might be more of an issue if you're very tall, and more well built. I have to mention the shower as well - it was very powerful with lots of hot water. Everything was kept super clean as well. The only major niggle I had was the traffic noise - it was constant! However, I know this isn't the hotels fault, and I did have a room at the front on the 5th floor, so the rooms at the back are probably fine. But it did affect my quality of sleep, so I have to mention it. Despite this, I would definitely stay again - it's in a great location, and easy walking distance for 2 tube stations and on a number of bus routes. (If you're going to be in London for more than 2 days and going to be using public transport, I would recommend getting an Oyster card - great value!)","hotelReviews":16,"location":5,"Location":"UK","Helpful":18,"date":"28 October 2012","sleepQ":3,"Cities":18,"title":"\u201cOverall a great hotel!\u201d","Reviews":26,"value":3,"service":4,"cleanliness":5,"rating":4,"rooms":3}

Although the rooms are tiny, the bonus for us was that the window opened and we were looking into a beautiful tree. It was quite noisy but you had the choice of windows closed(there were double windows) and no noise or windows open and a fresh air. We chose fresh air. The room was very clean and functional. Hair dryer, free wifi, plenty of hangers but minimum hanging space, tea, coffee, a safe, iron and small ironing board, and a lovely powerful shower with lots of hot water.The bathroom is very small. My husband is 6ft and when he cleaned his teeth he had to leave the bathroom door open to enable him to bend over the basin (opposite the door)! The bed a small double but comfortable.

{"User":"ferrnn","text":"As we pulled up outside and whilst checking in we were quite impressed with exterior and reception area, nicely decorated, etc. It all changed when we were put into a room on the \"1st floor\" which was in fact a basement. The room decoration was pleasant however had one double bed and 2 single beds all pushed together in a dim narrow room. To our pleasant surprise outside the window was the hotel's extractor fan/generator which made a racket all day and throughout the night. They were obviously trying to save energy as the bathroom and hallway lights were sensored so as you walk into the toilet it lit up, however, on 3 or 4 different occasions you'd be sat on the toilet and the lights would go off leaving you in pitch black - not very nice!! Another big pointer to mention is they try and catch you by saying when you check in that breakfast is from half 7 - 10 - we thought this was included in the price; however, found out when we were checking out that we had to pay £30 - £7.50 pp, per morning, so it was £7.50 each for what was initially some orange juice, crappy cereal selection and horrible rubber hard boiled eggs. Waitresses were also very rude and sneered at you. There were no locks on the doors so anyone with a key could just walk in, and seeing as it was 2 females - me and my mother, we felt very unsafe. One thing that really got on my wick was that yesterday morning as we were getting ready to check out, they decided to have the windows cleaned with a pressure washer which wasn't pleasant at all! Another note is that when we asked them to order a taxi they booked a private taxi service who they obviously work onside with. We waited 20 minutes for a cab to arrive to then be charged £13 to get from the hotel to chelsea, which would normally be a fiver in a black cab. After doing this journey a few times and walking around, we realised that the cab driver drove around in a circle and then charged us excessive amounts. DONT fall for this mistake, just hail yourself a cab. Overall, really unhappy with this hotel, the only good thing is the location. As soon as we payed our bill the reception staff ignored us and didn't even thank us or say goodbye so it was if they just wanted the money and for us to go. It's not worth the money and we will certainly not be coming here again.

This one is only ten minutes away from the Albert Hall and a 40 minute walk to the Proms in the park and the Radio 2 event next day. We found the Hotel extremely friendly, helpful and clean. Our room, 105, was well suited to us as my friend likes to be near the loo and I like a window. One bed was in front of the other( which sounds bizarre) but was well organised. Waitrose is a five minute walk down the road and there is an ASK restaurant and many others nearby. Also a good pub just up the road, and a tube station there too. I had another concert to go to 10 days later, on my own, at the Albert Hall. A 10 minute walk back down Queensgate road (which is nice and wide) I felt completely safe.

While it is centrally located, it's beautiful facade masks a dingy and poor quality motel. There were three of us traveling together so we booked a \"family room,\" which was quite spacious, however it was on the \"1st floor\" ie basement. Our window opened into an alcove that looked into another room and a brick wall, providing absolutely no privacy. The room and carpet felt damp during our entire stay. Luckily I'm a bit of a heavy sleeper, however one of my friends reported hearing the guests above us urinating and flusing the toliet above us. Our friend, the bride, stayed in a single room which was the size of a closet; there was barely enough room for two girls to stand in. Charging 2 pounds to use the internet in the lobby to print a boarding pass seems ridiculous. I haven't stayed in many hotels in London, but I feel strongly there must be better hotels.

In terms of that kind of proximity, this was great! In regards to other things, .... hmmm. The good: well, the location! The room, whilst tiny, was clean and quite well organised in terms of space. The Nemo fish in the lobby kept my son amused. The bad: noisy room, awful breakfast (I think they actually served spam ... go to one of the many excellent patisseries in the area instead), the cleaning staff barged in on us THREE times after a cursory knock.

{"User":"MDW_12","text":"With lots of hotels nearby in all price ranges there is no reason to stay at this hotel. I was working at a nearby museum and needed frequent email contact to complete my work. Eden Plaza advertises free hotel wide wifi. I was given a tiny room off the stairwell, isolated from the main hotel, and with no wifi reception. I had to go to lobby several times each day to check and send emails. There were a couple of time critical calls I needed to make. You are not allowed to access an outside line from the guest room so I had to do business standing at the reception desk. Because i had tools as well as luggage I asked if I could upgrade to a slightly larger room. I was told I had been given the largest sized room in the hotel. Then I saw several much larger rooms as the maids were cleaning. They simply lied to me. They were completely unhelpful and unconcerned. I was told at the museum that the hotel gives a discount to those visiting the museum. I asked at checkout and was told this was true but I would have to ask at checkin during my next visit. They were very careful, however, to bill me for the phone calls from the front desk. A review is not complete without mentioning the mattress: the most uncomfortable one I have ever seen in a hotel. It was thin, lumpy and very hard and I was unable to get a comfortable night's rest. This hotel is a disaster and I would avoid it at all costs.

{"User":"John O","text":"This is quite an unusual hotel, almost like a family run venue, not like any of the chain hotels. The most outstanding event that characterized our one week stay was that that we offered a very fast early check in for a 10 pound fee which was great after a long overnight flight. Why more hotels don\u2019t do this is a mystery, when working I checked out of hundreds of hotels at 5am to get an early flight. Surely those rooms could have been available before 2pm. The hotel was clean and well refurbished, with tea & coffee facilities with HT milk, toiletries and effective air-conditioning as well as being very well located. The room was small but suited us. The main problem we had was communicating with the hotel. It seems just about everything is handled by a service provider the Hotel Booking Network which we were able to contact by e-mail but all they did was refer us to the hotel who don\u2019t answer e-mails. I mentioned this to the receptionists (always all men) on our departure and they thought the HBN booking service should have done more and answered our reservation query. HNB said they did nothing except record the booking and send it to the hotel. Being on the other side of the world it meant making a middle of the night phone call to speak to someone to talk about reservations as the person answering the phone at night is apparently only the night watch-man to let people in the locked front door and does not provide a 24 hour front desk service. I would recommend this hotel to local residents in the UK but until they take some control of their own communications rather than use a third party I would not recommend it for travellers from other parts of the world.

The room had two single beds,seventeen inches between them, a small built-in hanging space for clothes and built in table between the beds which left no space for luggage--our cases had to be put on top of the hanging space otherwise we had no place to walk to get into bed-.Each morning the cases had to be put down on the bed to get our clothing ,it made life difficult ,.An alcove 2'6\" wide had space for a laptop .The onsuite had a shower over the bath,toilet and washbasin and very little space ,one knocked the wall trying to dry oneself.The room would be suitable for a person with no luggage,or if one bed was taken out it would have the space to put a chair. I was travelling with my adult son and had booked for five nights last October and unable to cancel due to the fact we had to pay on booking- this alone rang alarm bells with me- and on seeing the size of the room I knew why, we were trapped. .I spoke to the Manager and said the room was too small for two beds, he refused to show me another room. We had to take what we were given .Hence our last stay in London was not a pleasant one. I might add the room was not cleaned or beds made or changed during our stay- as the lass could not get in the room , there was no space with our hand luggage on the floor at the end of the beds.

We had a family room booked and on the first night stayed in Room 301, There are 4 single beds in this room and it can give the impression of being cramped as it is long and narrow with only one large window that looks into an enclosed central court yard area. The room is fitted with 2 tv's neither were working but were fixed the following morning even though it was the Queens diamond celebration Bank holiday. The bath room has a good fitted shower with lots of space but no bath. The following day we moved to Room 102 which is a far larger room has 2 double beds and also a single. The bathrom is fitted with a bath and overhead shower, again the bathroom area is well set out with ample space. The bedroom area in this room is large with ample space for all the family. Again the room looks into the central court yard area so don't expect great views of the city sky line. Both had comfortable, clean beds. The staff at the hotel are very helpful, will allow luggage to be left at the hotel prior to the booking in time, will provide directions if you need them and other helpful advice as required. The hotel is minutes away from the Tube and the Museum area, Natural History and Victoria and Albert,etc is just across the road.Hyde Park is just a walk up the street as is the Albert Hall. The surrounding area has plenty of Pubs, Cafes, Bakeries (French quarter) etc so easy to find somewhere nice to eat or shop.

{"User":"MareN2012","text":"Nervous about my first trip abroad, I choose Eden Plaza Kensington based on the information I saw online and location. I wanted someplace safe, comfortable, and not too pricey. Location was great! We were only a few blocks from the tube and across the street from the Natural History Museum and just down from the V&A Museum. Food and groceries were also close. I also felt safe. Kensington is an upper class area, clean and busy. Comfort of the hotel is across the board. We arrived early in the morning. Concerned that we could not check in early I let the man behind the desk know we'd like to stow our bags. For 10 pounds, we were offered to wait about 15-20 minutes and our room would be ready. GREAT! We appreciated that. Our room for myself, my husband and our adult daughter ended up being a strangely long and thin room with 4 single beds. Odd, but doable. The extra bed worked as an extra space to put bags. The room had 2 tvs. Odd again since we were all together anyway. The bathroom was tiny by U.S. standards, but was ok. The paint, however was peeling. I'm assuming that was because there was absolutely no ventilation in the bathroom. We were at the end of a small hall with only one room near us. What we discovered was the closet for the maids was right by our door. Each morning we heard that door slam time after time. The halls are too narrow for a housekeeping cart so the housekeepers had to keep coming back to the closet for towels. A bit annoying. The walls were pretty thin as we could hear the woman in the next room very clearly.On top of everything else, our rooms lighting was dim (small pot lights in the high ceiling) and our view was of 3 brick walls outside which were part of the hotel. The most annoying part was the free internet. It was very very spotty. I think it was down more than up. We were told several times that the engineer had to come the next day to fix it. What was most annoying was this was our main way of communicating with the folks we were meeting up with daily. Trying to check in for our flight home was also sketchy. Another odd thing was that we had forgotten to remove the \"do not disturb\" sign when we left the room, so understandably housekeeping did not visit us that day. However, when we called down to the desk to request some tp, we were told to come down to get it. WHAT? I have to say I would not stay here again. There were so many little annoyances, that it made the stay just simply unpleasant. Maybe it's just my American expectations, but come on! For what we paid and what we got, I expected so much more.","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Location":"San Jose, California","Helpful":1,"date":"23 May 2012","sleepQ":3,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cMy first trip to London\u201d","Reviews":2,"value":3,"service":1,"cleanliness":3,"rating":2,"rooms":3}

Overall a good place but makes sure you have a room in a quiet area of the ogle otherwise you can forget to sleep. Last but not least.

The Spode would not support FaceTime home which I was assured it would when booking. I asked if there was room service at reception and was handed a pizza delivery menu. Staff on arrival were pleasant. Staff on departure were miserable an unfriendly. As I was leaving, a guy on reception was arguing with a customer about breakfast being included in the price.

{"User":"LAKeogh","text":"I stayed here for two nights. On arrival, the staff were very helpful & polite. I had arrived early (9.30 am) & a room was not ready for me, so they allowed me to store my luggage as I went to Earl's Court for an expo. I returned approx 12.30 my room was available. I was upgraded to a double, which was great. I got out of the lift & entered my room. I must admit, it was minuscule. I could not imagine two people staying in that room. For me, it was fine. It was spotlessly clean & tidy. I had been on the go since 2 am so a nap was in order & I found the bed bed very comfortable. I also had a restful nights sleep. I was awakened @ 6.30 am by traffic outside my window. The noise insulation is not great, but remember, this an old building, so I don't think they would be allowed to mess with the windows. I rose @ 7 am & hit the shower, which was great. All in all, this was a great hotel for me. It was close to where I needed to be, plenty to do within a 5 minute walk (museums, restaurants, pubs...) & it's in between Gloucester Rd & South Kensington tube stations. Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Gardens, Royal Geographical Society.....all within 5 minute walk. If you're travelling on you own, just book a room. If there is more than one, get a family room, you'll need the space. I would recommend this hotel. Room Tip: For more than one person, get a larger room, as even the doubles are small.

For a light sleeper this means no sleep at all. Beds are hard, the ones new decor has got mucky, personnel can't help you out. Why didn't I think twice at that price? The pictures are slightly deceiving, but when a room is this cheap something must be wrong with it and the hotel is not going to tell you. The only thing good is that it's close to museums and it allows you to be there early before the crowds march in. The Dino section at national history museum has enormous queues after 12, but not at ten as my daughter and I discovered :-) but there must be better places in the area.

We were going to a gig in the Royal Albert Hall (Bright Eyes - it was fantastic!! :) , so we wanted somewhere near there, but besides that there was so much else in the area that makes it a perfect spot for tourists. It is a very nice part of town (you can almost SMELL the money from the locals, it's kinda funny seeing all the Ferraris and the likes dotted around the place, and all the rich posers trying to outdo each other! ;) There's lots of nice coffee shops and eateries in the area, albeit probably a little more expensive than other parts of town. You are right beside all the museums - which unfortunately I did not get to visit this time round as I was really sick for the entire stay - doubled over in agony with a kidney infection and barely managed to even make it through the gig at all - besides the gig I spent most of the stay in bed! :( But if I could do it over minus the crippling pain, I would definitely stay here again! The only negative I would mention is that the staff were really not very welcoming. I'm sure I looked a little worse for wear when I arrived, and for the entire time I was there - what with the incessant excruciating crippling pain I was experiencing! But our appearance should not have been an issue, we were paying guests and I really felt like they were looking down their noses at us - as i saw them being perfectly nice and friendly to the more glamorous guests! I'm sure if I went back there in full health and glammed up for a night on the town they would probably treat me differently, although if I do go back there I'll probably wear my scruffiest smelliest gym gear just to mess with the snobbish staff! ;)","hotelReviews":11,"location":5,"Location":"Dublin, Ireland","Helpful":24,"date":"28 March 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":16,"title":"\u201cGreat location, great hotel, staff could learn to crack a smile once in a while though!\u201d","Reviews":43,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"BriennaH","text":"We found this hotel online and obviously, deluded by their misleading photographs, we booked in thinking we were in for a fantastic holiday in a great London location. I used to live in London for several years - I know there's a limit on space, but when you advertise a triple room in a space of just over 20m sq, you know you're not delivering a decent product. For the price that they're asking - look elsewhere. Just down the road is a fantastic NH hotel which we changed to after the second night (we asked to be uprgaded for the second night we stayed as it was impossible for us to be comfortable when there are 3 adults with the beds butted up against each other and a single 80cm wide corridor to store our luggage) which will offer you so much more for less money! The hotel is operated (and presumably owned) by an Indian gentleman who seems to only employ Indian people who find it completely normal to have avid conversations in Hindu right in front of you as you stand there for 2 minutes before being greeted. They told me I had to pay in advance, had already charged my card while I was back in Australia without my authorisation and told me what I could and couldn't do. I work in a 5 star property and have been in the luxury hotel industry for 9 years now. Funnily enough, the rubbish he was telling me about how he couldn't refund me because of the computer system he uses was in fact the very same system I have used in each property I work at so this hotel was deemed remarkably unprofessional in my eyes when I had to tell the man behind the counter how to do his job properly and advise him that I didn't appreciate the lies he was telling me and that I know for a fact how to rectify the error and continued to then explain to him where to go on the system to do this. In summary - you do not get what you pay for - this hotel is ridiculously marked up just for the location which is nice, but not essential. Everything in South Ken is so close I highly recommend you stay elsewhere and the lovely streets past cafes and pubs. To be paying as much as we did for a tiny and cramped room with incredible mould growth throughout the bathroom was an error of our judgement. Next time I will see a room first before I make a reservation.","hotelReviews":0,"location":1,"Location":"Brisbane, Australia","Helpful":1,"date":"21 March 2012","sleepQ":1,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cVery poor experience\u201d","Reviews":1,"value":1,"service":1,"cleanliness":1,"rating":1,"rooms":1}

When we arrived, it couldnt have been close enough, it was across the road, you couldnt get any better than that. On walking in was lovely, they smiled, and asked how we were. We had cards to get into the room, they explained how the cards worked for the lift, told us that there was breakfast, i think breakfast was extra, so ask, and make sure. it was lovely clean inside the lobby. we paid £124.00 for 1 night. I would expected the breakfast to be thrown in for that, what they did give me was there card, so if i booked again, i would put this number in, and get a discount, by booking direct with them. I booked through booking.com so it was there prices, i wont do that again, saying that london hotels are not cheap, so make sure you look around. We was given 4 single beds, which was great for us,,There was 2 adults and 1 child. it was very clean, no dust, we all slept very nicely. couldnt really open the window, i left it open, and when we came back, it was cool, so it did its job. We was 5 minutes away from the station, also Boots was there, incase you needed anything, Also resturants too. There was a safe in the bedroom, which was a added touch. the bathroom was lovely, with the added bonus of little bottles of shampoo/body. it might be small for eveyone else, not for me, we had a loo, lovely large sink, with mirrors all around, and a large shower, and beautiful hot water all the time, i was the last one to get in there, and it was still running hot, now thats a bonus, usually hotels run out of hot water, and then you dont want to get in because it too cold. we had 301 room, it was longways how it was set out, 2 flat tv's, a desk, with a hairdryer in the draw, so u dont have to carry one in your bag. A kettle with all the cups/suguar/milk, which is good especially for london, as they would want to charge you if you wanted a cup of tea. There was a bar also behind the desk, so if you wanted a drink which was nice. a computer also with wi-fi. We didnt hear any noise at all. We all loved it, and will be coming back soon. we didnt use the resturant, so i cant mark on that, so i wont run it down because its not fair, they made our day/night very special, thanks. also they had fish nemo was in there too Room Tip: we had room 301, and we didnt hear any noise at all, i always say it all depends on the people that...

{"User":"MJBrussels","text":"The Eden Plaza cancelled my booking without informing me, and lied to me about it when I tried to check in. I booked my room a month before my stay and got an email confirmation of the booking. When I arrived, they told me they had tried to process my credit card and the payment hadn't gone through, and when I didn't arrive before 6pm they had to cancel the booking to ensure they would fill the room (6pm was an arbitrary deadline: they hadn't asked for an expected arrival time, and I arrived at 7pm as planned). It seems highly unlikely that they had actually tried to process my card, as I used it successfully in other places on the same day, both before and after they claim to have tried to process it, and there was more than enough credit available for their booking. When I asked why they hadn't tried to contact me about the failed payment, they said that they did not have my email address because I'd booked through a travel agent. This was untrue: I had booked directly through the hotel's own website, and received confirmation from the hotel's email address. I had the printout of the confirmation with me, and although the hotel manager kept talking over me to try to avoid answering my questions, he eventually admitted that the confirmation email had come directly from them and that therefore they did have my email address. He then changed his story and claimed that there are simply too many failed payments each day for the hotel to email every guest to investigate. Again, this seems highly unlikely; even if it were true it would suggest that the hotel staff are simply incompetent and/or the hotel is inadequately staffed. Regardless, I asked why they hadn't tried to call me instead, and the manager said that they didn't have my phone number. This was easily exposed as another lie, as my phone number was there on the printed email confirmation! By this point, I was very angry and demanded they give me a room, and the manager laughed as he told me the hotel was full. Eventually he booked me a room at another hotel, and told me to run for the bus which was just going past outside so I could reach it. At no point did they offer an apology or try to make amends: the least they could have done would have been to give me a taxi ride to the new hotel, but instead I was being told to run through the rain to the bus! The manager even told me that I was lucky to have gotten a good rate with them by booking in advance, but there is nothing particularly \"lucky\" about getting a standard advance rate (of the sort offered by very many hotels), even less so if the room is cancelled without my knowledge! I suspect the hotel had deliberately overbooked, cancelling guests who were paying a lower rate if they didn't arrive by a certain time. My colleague, who is paying a higher rate for the same room, did not have his booking cancelled, although he arrived later than I did. In summary, they cancelled my booking for no good reason, lied to me about it, and were unapologetic and rude afterwards. I experienced no good service of any kind in my short encounter with Eden Plaza, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There was a happy ending to the story: in the end I did get a taxi to go to my new hotel, and the driver very kindly gave me a free ride after hearing what had just happened. I only mention this to give credit where it's due, and to show that this obnoxious hotel manager's behaviour is by no means typical in London. Room Tip: Stay somewhere else!

{"User":"grayfam","text":"Having done my homework I recon this is by far the cheapest option for visiting the Kensington Museums - 5 mins stroll from the V and A which is the furthest away of the 3. Its also very near the Gloucester Road tube station , and the bus to Kensington High street stops right outside - so for me fab location. The area is busy so yes there is traffic noise - this would also be the case if you had a (several million pound) property nearby. Take ear plugs if it bothers you. The hotel itself is squeaky clean and a lot nicer in decor than a travel lodge, for example. Everything in my room worked well. I found the bed very comfortable. The window (including secondary glazing) opened and there was good air conditioning if required. The rooms are small - I actually got a triple to myself and while 3 of us would have managed it would have been a squeeze when not actually lying down. However, that is not why people go to London - or if they do want to spend more time in the room they will prioritise that feature, I imagine. I found the people running the establishment to be very polite , a smile works wonders ! If they have to put up with attidudues like the one from the previous reviewer, I think they show remankable restraint.

No washclothes in the hotel so had to ackwardly wash with a med. sized towel each day. I could not call out (either locally or internationally) using my AT&T phone card. When I asked at the desk about it, they rather smuggly (like dodging good English with a lot of pointing, as well) said they did not have that service there and I would have to go down the street to a phone booth. Needing to conduct business with paperwork, I said that would not be acceptable and they just shrugged. I asked for a nice room with a view and did get a clean, albeit much-smaller-than-Rydges-Kensington room (where I had previously stayed) and had a good look out at a leafy tree canopy. Bad for me though, I forgot to add QUIET and was placed right on the corner of 2 busy intersections which, with no soundproof windows, caused sleepless nights, even on the 5th floor. Plus, they knew they were doing street construction when I arrived and I awoke to the sound of jackhammers early in the morning after the traffic finally died down at 2-3 am. Also, while I appreciate energy savings and the room key card-stand deal where everything shuts off when you leave the room, thsi was funny-bad to the extreme. The bathroom lights here shut off automatically after about 3 minutes and whether you are sitting or showering, you must wave your arms frantically or open and shut the shower doors to get them back on - frustrating, to say the least. I booked these 2 hotels 3 months in advance using Trip Advisor. This hotel did cost a little less (average per day of £10) than the nearby Rydges Kensington (which I found to be a good stay when I specified that I wanted a view and quiet), but everything and everyone at at Rydges was so nice (despite the renovations), I truly wished I would have stayed there longer for a little more. But what do you know sight unseen? I wasn't even offered a receipt upon check out at the Eden PLaza and had to ask for one. And no great thank yous from them or any offer of help opening the front hotel door getting bags in or out, even though 3 guys at desk were just standing there watching. Just blank stares... Finally, the most expensive computer-use rates I found in the area (£2 per 15 minutes!). I found a great Internet Cafe nearby that I went to instead (£2.2 per hour), even though they said they did not know of one. Just majorly disappointing, the Eden Plaza.

The rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are surprisingly spacious given the size of the rooms. The bathrooms looked exceptionally clean, but at closer glance, our bathroom floors looked like it needed slightly better cleaning (black and brown spots). Internet was extremely choppy and when we ran into airline problems, they wouldn't let us use the phones in the room to call out. I guess it 'does the job'. HOWEVER, for the same price, we stayed at a Bed & Breakfast but a few miles from here in Vauxhall called 69TheGrove and for the same price, we were given unlimited, barely-ever-choppy internet, free homemade breakfast (by the owner), and much much more friendlier service and bigger, cleaner rooms.

However, the rooms were quite small and noisy. I don't know if it's because we got 'bargain rooms' or not, but our Double room was between floors in the stairwell, and the double bed was shoved against the wall, with little floor space. The Twin room for the teenagers had the beds end to end on one wall. The hotel is situated on the corner of Queen's Gate and Cromwell, and the traffic seemed non-stop, even on a snowy weekend. (Having our iPod with speakers and playing a white noise (ocean waves) helped us to go to sleep with the traffic noise. For our teens whose room did not face the street, they had problems ALL night with very loud and noisy neighbors. (They now know to call the front desk in this case, for future reference.) The location was across the street from the wonderful Natural History Museum, and in between two Tube (Metro) stations. I think the Gloucester Road station is closer, with great places to eat and quick shopping for necessities. We ate at Paul's Patissierie, the great little restaurant two doors down from Paul's for breakfast (went there twice but cannot remember the name) which had fresh squeezed OJ. The Stanhope Arms pub was wonderful as well, for atmosphere, food and drinks (we found out later that they had cheaper breakfast)! We had a delightful trip in London during the snow storm, but would have also liked a restful, QUIET night's sleep. If noise doesn't bother you, this is a great place to stay as the beds are not worn down and the shower is wonderful.

Finding it- The best local tube station is gloucester road which is literally 4 minutes walk towards the nautral history museem. As you walk down the road it is last corner on the left before the start of the history museem on your right. Its the ideal place to stay as there are restaurants near by and things to do. Hotel- I think it has probably been done up quite recently, everything is new and stylish. The lobby is Clean, tidy with a smiling face ready to help and welcome you. The room was a little small, long and thin. It was fine for my mother and I just for a weekend but if your staying longer its not ideal. The room was clean and tidy and kept that way. Our beds were comfortable, had a lovely en-suite. Again it was small but enough- Shower was amazing! Staff- They can't do enough for you. After checking out they will keep your bags for a small charge if you dont want to carry them around etc. Any questions we asked they always had an answer or could give us the information to get the answer. Great place to stay and cant recommend it enough.","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Oxford, United Kingdom","Helpful":1,"date":"27 October 2010","sleepQ":3,"Cities":2,"title":"\u201cGreat location, Lovely, Friendly and cheap for london\u201d","Reviews":2,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":4,"rooms":5}
